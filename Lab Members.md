#Members of the Hass lab
This is where I'll add profiles of different people in the hass lab (including myself). For ease of contact, I'll also add a form that people can use to contact each person.

The format should be name first, then title, then project info (where appropriate). Perhaps include a pubmed link that searches for papers by this perosn?

(the one and only) Daniel Hass, lab PI
[insert picture of Dan dressed like a detective]

I'll add more people once the damn lab has actually begun!!!
