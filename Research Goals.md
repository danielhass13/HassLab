# Research Goals for the Hass lab

#### Provide a quantitative map of energy metabolism in the retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)
  - Which fuels are used by each tissue to generate energy _in vivo_?
  - What is the rate at which energy is generated _in vivo_?
  - Expected outcomes
    - Gain the ability to generate an accurate metabolic model of each tissue, including reaction rates
    - Define better conditions for retina and RPE culture

#### Define the factors which control the rate of energy metabolism
  - Manipulate levels of ciculating metabolites, to determine how retina and RPE metabolism are affected
  - Manipulate levels of metabolic proteins in different retinal cells, to determine how retina and RPE metabolism are affected
  - Express forms of metabolic proteins that are not allosterically inhibited in different cells of the retina
  - Expected outcomes
    - a
    - a
    
#### Determine whether manipulations to retina or RPE energy metabolism improve retinal health and preserve vision
  - Increase the rate of energy generation, determine whether it protects the retina from different forms of retinal degeneration
  - Expected outcomes
    - a
    - a
