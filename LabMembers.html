  <title>Members of the Hass lab!</title>

<body>
<p>This is where I'll add profiles of different people in the hass lab (including myself). For ease of contact, I'll also add a form that people can use to contact each person.</p>
<p>The format should be name first, then title, then project info (where appropriate). Perhaps include a pubmed link that searches for papers by this perosn?</p>
<h1>(the one and only) Daniel Hass, lab PI</h1>
